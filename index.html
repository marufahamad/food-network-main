            <p class="link-area-margin">My name is Sadia Rahman (Asha). Basically I'm a Housewife. Cooking is my
                passion. When I got free time, I
                try to cook something new. Now I want to share what I cooked.</p>

            <h2>My recipes</h2>
            <p>Work from your Strength. Donâ€™t try to master everything. Become known for a few dishes, perhaps even the
                near perfection of one. Discover your obsession, then make yourself a slave to it: the mastery of a
                traditional dish, the combination of ingredients that have never before met, precision in presentation,
                devotion to a culinary heritage, the introduction of color where it never before existed.</p>

                    , whether you are in good or bad mood , it is chotpoti and fuchka that makes your day !!</p>

                <h3>Green Salad</h3>
                <p>This salad is good for a side dish or a meal on its own. I make it often for my family and they
                    always enjoy it.</p>

                <h3>Pasta</h3>
                <p>This rich and flavorful sauce is the perfect match for bitter radicchio. It is incredibly easy to
                    make and goes well with any type of (preferably fresh) pasta. My favorite pasta to have this with is
                    gnocchi. The light and fluffy potato pasta goes well with the rich sauce. Garnish with Parmesan
                    cheese and parsley.</p>
